## About me
Hi! I am 22 years old, and I recently graduated from university. 
I am an engineer, but **I want to become a programmer**.
During my studies, I learned about programming, but I realized that I want to do it only when I started working. 
Programming experience is limited to performing laboratory work at the university.
Despite this, **I want to study frontend and work in a successful company**, even if it takes a lot of effort.
I believe that I can succeed, because I have been involved in sports and *I know what the will to win is!*

## Skills
Basics of HTML, CSS. I study JS, Git.
